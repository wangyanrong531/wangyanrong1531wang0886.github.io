I have two bachelor's degrees.I am major in Chinese language and literature, minor in environmental design.I graduated in 2018, then I went to Australia as a solo backpacker for one year. I did seven kinds of casual jobs there to earn my travel fees and travelled the whole country. Then I went to back to China to work at the Bytedace technology company. My position was user operation,because of this work experience, I realized how I like create new things. That's why I am here to learn <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>. I need my personal website page to show the creative objects.

            I have so many hobbies because I want to have great memories during each life period. I am a big fan of music. I play a traditional Chinese instrument called the Pipa, and I startd to learn the cello one year ago. I enjoy every art-related play activity,such as painting, video making, photography,storytelling, live music, drama etc.<strong><em>I am willing to try new things all the time.</em></strong>
